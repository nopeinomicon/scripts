# nope scripts
A collection of my own shell-script utility functions

All functions/scripts attempt to be:
- POSIX compliant if possible
- Usable primarily by sourcing ( `. ./init.sh` will expose all functions to user shell )
- Tuned for my personal setup, but useable with others if necessary
- Low-dependency (standard tools are used where reasonable)

If you find these useful and would like to see a feature/fix here, issue filing and pull requests are welcome.
